# Custom Instructions for Custom GPTs

Welcome to our Custom Instructions repository, a collaborative platform for those eager to master customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and building LLM tools. We aim to empower you with the knowledge to create personalized LLM tools and applications, akin to how many have learned to use Microsoft Office tools as a basic skill in the modern world. We believe that the ability to customize LLM tools will be an essential skill to have in the next era.<br>

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of example custom instructions, each organized in its folder. These instructions are designed to help you customize your own LLM tools and enhance their capabilities. Note that these instructions are only a template and a good starting point, and the objective is to get you started experimenting with custom instructions to control your LLMs. The content in this repo will be updated following our workshops on this topic. Various building blocks are used in custom instructions, and you can find simple instructions to more complicated ones as we go through workshop sessions. Each custom instruction has different building blocks, and you can always mix and match them to build complex instructions for the LLMs. We also have a different directory to share multiagent frameworks/templates and provide an easy way for everyone to experiment with these templates.

This repository serves as your starting point in the fascinating world of LLM customization:
- Custom Instructions: This is a compilation of templates to guide you in customizing LLM tools. We focus on practical, hands-on experimentation and encourage you to explore and experiment. We focus on defining helpful building blocks in a custom instruction that can create predictable behaviors in LLMs.
- Multi-Agent Frameworks: Dive into templates, introduce yourself to multi-agent systems, foster an understanding of collaborative agent behavior, orchestrate workflows, etc. 
- Collaborative Learning: We believe in learning by doing. This space is for those who wish to upskill in LLMs, making tool customization accessible to everyone.

## Workshop

We are excited to announce that this repository will also be shared in an upcoming workshop on how to customize LMs with custom instructions. The workshop will provide step-by-step guidance on effectively using these instructions to create custom GPTs. We hope you will be inspired by the building blocks introduced in various instructions and help you build your LLM tools. The content of this repo will be regularly updated as we move forward with our workshop series. If you would like to join our workshop sessions and participate in our podcast/workshops on using LLMs tools as a new skill, please refer to this link: [WorkShops](https://forms.gle/QkHdALYhsgmjFUnK8)<br>
Please mark your calendars for an upcoming workshop that will venture beyond the basics into the art of customizing LLMs with our custom instructions. This workshop is your gateway to transforming these building blocks into personalized LLM tools.
