# Inner Monologue for Custom LLM Instructions

## Overview
The 'Inner Monologue' concept introduces a novel approach to customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing their response generation process. By integrating an 'Inner Monologue' into LLM instructions, developers can create more nuanced, context-aware, and dynamic interactions. This directory hosts a collection of instruction files and examples demonstrating how to implement and utilize the 'Inner Monologue' as a foundational building block within larger LLM customization efforts. Note that this is only a template and a building block and can be customized, feel free experimenting and sharing your feedback. This instuction is less than 1500 characters and can be used for ChatGPT custom instruction of be part of a larger instruction for custom GPTs (with 8000 character limit). [Inspired by Dr. Synapse](https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Synapse_CoR).

## What is Inner Monologue?
Inner Monologue is a structured approach designed to refine the response generation process of LLMs. It consists of two main components:
- **FACTS**: A list of relevant facts that aids in formulating a more effective response. These facts serve as the working memory for the LLM, ensuring that responses are grounded in the context of the conversation.
- **INSTRUCTION**: A crafted instruction tailored to guide the response generation process, aiming for clarity, relevance, and effectiveness. This instruction is informed by the FACTS section and guides the LLM in how to approach the user's request.
- You can also add other elements to the inner monolouge variable to enhance performace for various tasks.

## How to Use
This repository contains templates and examples that demonstrate the implementation of the Inner Monologue concept within custom LLM instructions. To integrate Inner Monologue into your project, follow these steps:
1. **Explore the Examples**: Familiarize yourself with the provided examples to understand how Inner Monologue can be integrated into different types of LLM instructions.
2. **Customize Your Instructions**: Use the templates as a starting point to create custom instructions tailored to your specific use case. Incorporate your own FACTS and INSTRUCTION sections based on the needs of your project.
3. **Test and Refine**: Implement your custom instructions with an LLM and observe the interaction outcomes. Refine your FACTS and INSTRUCTION sections based on feedback and performance.

## Applications
The Inner Monologue concept is versatile and can be applied across various domains, including but not limited to:
- Enhancing LLMs' ability to understand complex queries in technical fields.
- Improving the quality of creative writing generated by LLMs.
- Customizing LLM responses for specific industries or user demographics.
